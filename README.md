# first-milestone

For my first milestone project, i had decided to create a color guessing game using RGB instead of hexcodes. There are two difficulties that change the amount of squares that are shown on the screen. Easy only showing three squares and Hard showing six squares. The objective of the game as some would know, is to click the colored square that matches the RGB numbers displayed in the header. If wrong color is clicked, that square will disappear and will leave you  with a remaining number of squares. 

Along with picking the wrong color, a message will inform you of you wrong decision. Once the right color is chosen, another message will let you know that you are correct and the header background color will change the to the correct color. 


I think this project is for perfect for anyone who is a beginner in learnign and developing front-end, more specifically javascript.
