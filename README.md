# first-milestone
I wanted to mak something simple and i plan on getting into app development once i am finished with this bootcamp. 

In light, whats a better way for any junior UX/UI designer and app developer to work on their rgb codes?
    - With a color guessing game of course, but only using rgb, not hex codes
