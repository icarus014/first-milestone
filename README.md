## What I've created
For my first milestone project, I had decided to create a color guessing game using RGB instead of hexcodes. 

### Game Rundown
There are two difficulties that change the amount of squares that are shown on the screen. 
Easy only showing three squares and Hard showing six squares. The objective of the game as some would know, is to click the colored square that matches the RGB numbers displayed in the header. If the wrong color is clicked, the chosen square will disappear and will leave you  with a remaining number of squares. 

Along with picking the wrong color, a message will inform you of you wrong decision. 

Once the right color is chosen, another message will let you know that you are correct and the header background color will change the to the correct color. You will then have the ability to change and reset the game with new colors, once you you have chosen the right answer. 

### What I think About this Project
I think this project is for perfect for anyone who is a beginner in learning and developing front-end, more specifically javascript. Learning RGB values is important for those who are looking to get into design specific jobs such as app development or UX/UI Design.
